Restaurant Homepage Project

In this project, I practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a simple restaurant homepage using only JavaScript to generate the entire contents of the website.


The restaurant homepage project consists of the following features:

Bare-bones homepage with an image, headline, and some copy about the restaurant.
Creating HTML elements using JavaScript.
Tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages.
The contents of each tab are in their own module.
Tab-switching logic in index.js.

Conclusion
This project is a great opportunity to practice DOM manipulation and creating HTML elements using JavaScript. With tabbed browsing, we can see how JavaScript can make our website more interactive and user-friendly.
